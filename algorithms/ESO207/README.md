# ESO207A-2019I

This repository contains my solutions to programming assignments of the course ESO207 (Data Structures and Algorithms). They have been implemented in C++, and mostly implemented without the use of any predefined data structures.

## List of Questions for PAs

* Programming Assingment 1
	* Counting Inversions - Merge Sort based code for counting number of inversions in an array.
	* Rotated Sorted Array - Finding out whether a number is present in a cyclic shifted sorted array in O(log n) time.

* Programming Assingment 2
	* Infix To Postfix - Program to transform a given string input from infix expression to postfix expression using stacks
	* SpiderMan - Easy stack question for finding span of an array

* Programming Assingment 3
	* Bipartite Graph - Finding whether a graph is Bipartite using Breadth First Search
	* Largest SCC - Following the algorithm written in Introduction to Algorithms

* Programming Assingment 4
	* Most Reliable Path - Using Djisktra for finding the shortest path (implemented using adjacency matrix)
	* Spanning Trees - Finding the MST of a graph repeatedly by using Kruskal's algorithm

* Bonus Programming Assignment 1
	* FFT - Using the divide and conquer algorithm to find the FFT of a polynomial
	* Convolution using FFT - Use the above program to do the mathematical operation of convolution

* Bonus Programming Assignment 2
