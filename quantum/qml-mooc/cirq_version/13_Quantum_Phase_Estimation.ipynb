    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum Fourier transform and quantum phase estimation provide the foundation for many quantum algorithms, including the quantum matrix inversion, which is extensively used in quantum machine learning. It is therefore worthwhile developing a good understanding of these building blocks before moving on to more complex algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We must emphasize that starting with this notebook, the algorithms presented are coherent quantum protocols. By that, we mean that the input and output of an algorithm is a quantum state that we do not have classical information about. The protocol itself might use measurements: in this sense, they are not fully coherent, since we gain some, but incomplete classical information about the quantum system. We might also perform post-selection, which means that a gate is controlled by the classical output of a measurement. In some cases, we entirely discard a calculation based on a measurement output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does it matter that we begin and end up with quantum states? Can't we just use state preparation starting from classical data and then perform tomography on the final state? We could do that, but state preparation and tomography are resource-intensive, and they are likely to destroy any quantum advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional problem is that the quantum Fourier transformation and other quantum algorithms similar in complexity require a very large number of gates on a large number of high-quality qubits. This is why the practical relevance of these algorithms is not immediate, but since they are the core of many quantum machine learning protocols, it is essential that we take a look at them."

    "# Quantum Fourier Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum Fourier transform is a quantum algorithm for the discrete Fourier transform over the amplitudes of a wavefunction. The exposition here follows the introduction in [[1](#1)]. A similar approach can be found in the [Qiskit tutorials](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/community/algorithms/shor_algorithm.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "The classical discrete Fourier transform acts on a vector $\\vec{x}=\\begin{bmatrix}x_0\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ x_{N-1}\\end{bmatrix}$ and maps it to the vector $\\vec{y}=\\begin{bmatrix}y_0\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ y_{N-1}\\end{bmatrix}$, where $y_k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}x_je^{ \\boldsymbol{2\\pi i} \\frac{jk}{N}}$.\n",

    "To derive a circuit for a power of two $N=2^n$, consider the transform acts on the state $| x \\rangle = | x_1...x_n \\rangle$ where $x_1$ is the most significant bit, unlike the usual convention followed in the course. We will rewrite a number $y$ in the fractional binary notation  as $j = 0.j_1...j_n = \\sum_{k=1}^n j_k/2^k$. For example $0.8125_d = 0.1101_b = \\sum_{k=1}^4 j_k/2^k = 1/2 + 1/4 + 0/8 + 1/16$, where the subscripts $d$ stands for decimal and $b$ for binary.

Since $U$ is unitary, all of its eigenvalues have an absolute value of 1. By convention, $\\theta$ is taken to be in $[0,1[$ and is called the *phase* of $U$ associated to $|\\psi\\rangle$\n",

    "The eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ is encoded in one set of quantum registers. An additional set of $n$ qubits forms an ancilla register. At the end of the procedure, this ancilla register should contain an approximation of the [binary fraction](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/binary/binary-fractions.html) associated to $\\theta$, with n-bits precision. A critical element is the ability to perform the controlled unitary $C-U^{2^k}$ -- it is usually assumed to be provided to the phase estimation protocol.\n",

    "First, the uniform superposition is prepared in the ancilla register via the application of Hadamard gates $H$. These qubits will act as controls for the unitary operators at different time steps. Our goal is to create a superposition of $U$ as the unitary is applied for different durations. Since the eigenvalues are always situated on the complex unit circle, these differently evolved components in the superposition help reveal the eigenstructure. Given that the ancilla register we have a superposition of all possible time steps between $0$ and $2^{n-1}$, we will end up with a superposition of all possible evolutions to encode binary representations of the eigenvalues.
