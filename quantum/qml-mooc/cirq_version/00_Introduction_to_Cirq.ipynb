    "[Cirq](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq) is Google's python framework for creating, editing, and invoking Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) circuits. For setting it up on your computer, please refer to the [Cirq documentation](https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Here we spell out the details of Cirq that are critical for the rest of the notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary design philosophy behind Cirq is that the details of the quantum hardware can't be ignored for NISQ algorithms. Consequently, Cirq's abstractions closely mimic the underlying hardware. When declaring a qubit register, the connectivity structure must be specified. For our purposes, the most important basic elements of Cirq programs are (grid) qubits and circuits:"

    "Besides `GridQubit`, another possibility is `LineQubit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, a `Circuit` object is very closely related to the abstract quantum circuit model. The quantum circuit takes gates that operate on the quantum registers. When a measurement gate is applied, the result is identified by a key. (In addition to `Circuit`, Cirq has another representation of quantum circuits called `Schedule`, which is more closely tied to hardware and includes detailed information about the timing and duration of the gates.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we define our algorithm in terms of gates and measurements, we need to execute the circuit. In Cirq, the simulators make a distinction between a \"run\" and a \"simulation\". A \"run\" mimics the actual quantum hardware and does not allow access to the amplitudes of the wave function of the system. A \"simulation\" allows for operations which would not be possible on hardware, such as examining the wave function.\n",

    "\n",
    "If `run` was the only way to perform a simulation, we would have a hard time debugging our quantum algorithms. Why? As we don't have access to the quantum state using `run`, we would have to reconstruct the quantum state based on the measurements we make, which is not a trivial task in general. True, this is the only option we have on the actual hardware, but in a simulator, we have one more possibility: we could actually inspect the simulated quantum state (the wavefunction). Cirq provides a way to do this using the `simulate` method.\n",
    "\n",
