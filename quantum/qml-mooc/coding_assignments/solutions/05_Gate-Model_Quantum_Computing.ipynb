    "**Exercise 1** (2 points). Quantum computers typically initialize their qubit registers in the $|0\\rangle$ state. This means that if there is any particular state we would like to work with, first we have to figure out how to create that state with a circuit. Some states are easier to prepare than others. If you are just given a random vector, say, $\\begin{bmatrix}0.36\\\\  0.8704\\end{bmatrix}$, it is not easy to figure out how to prepare it. In fact, the very purpose of quantum computing is to prepare a probability distribution of interest, that is, a state. So in some ways, generic state preparation is as hard as or equivalent to quantum computation. On the other hand, some states are easy to prepare; for instance, the state $\\frac{-|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Create a circuit in your preferred framework that prepares this state. The object should be called `circuit`."
