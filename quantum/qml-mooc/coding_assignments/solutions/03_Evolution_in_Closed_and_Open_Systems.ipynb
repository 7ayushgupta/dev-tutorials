Even if the system starts in a pure state, the interaction with the environment will turn it into a mixed state. The state loses coherence (the off-diagonal terms in the density matrix). Furthermore, increasing noise may completely destroy entanglement, so we can no longer use it as a resource for calculations. In general, it is a very hard problem to tell how much noise can be tolerated so that the remaining state is still useful for some calculations.\n",
