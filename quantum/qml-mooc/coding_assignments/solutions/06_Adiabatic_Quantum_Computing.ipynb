    "# Unitary evolution and the Hamiltonian\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 1** (2 points). You have already seen that the eigendecomposition of a Hamiltonian gives you the energy levels of the system. This comes out of the time-independent Schrödinger equation, $H|\\psi \\rangle =E|\\psi \\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation establishes the connection between unitary operations (solutions of the Schrödinger equation) and the Hamiltonian. Imagine, for instance, that you are looking for the Hamiltonian that implements the phase gate $S=\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\\\\ 0& i\\end{bmatrix}$. This is a valid unitary, so we are looking for a time-independent Hamiltonian such that $S = \\exp(-i Ht/\\hbar)$. The $S$ gate is diagonal, so will be our Hamiltonian. That makes matrix exponentiation easy. So we are looking for a Hamiltonian $H=\\begin{bmatrix}h_1 & 0\\\\0 & h_2\\end{bmatrix}$ for some values $h_1$ and $h_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can take, for instance $\\sigma^Z=\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\\\\0 & -1\\end{bmatrix}$ and substract an identity matrix -- this only shifts the energy. That would give us a Hamiltonian $H=\\sigma^Z-\\mathbb{1}=\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0\\\\0 & -2\\end{bmatrix}$. So now we have $S=\\exp(-i Ht/\\hbar)=\\begin{bmatrix}\\exp(-i 0t/\\hbar) & 0\\\\0 & \\exp(i 2t/\\hbar)\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\\\\0 & \\exp(i 2t/\\hbar)\\end{bmatrix}$. Calculate the value for $t/\\hbar$ to get the $S$ gate from this Hamiltonian. Store the result in a variable called `t`."

We can start from some Hamiltonian $H_0$ and slowly change it to some other Hamiltonian $H_1$, for instance, on a linear schedule: $H(t) = (1-t) H_0 + t H_1$. The speed of change heavily depends on the energy gap, that is, the difference between the ground state energy and the first excited state of all Hamiltonians $H(t)$, $t\\in[0,1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to craft a Hamiltonian where this gap is small, so the speed limit has to be low. If you take a classical Ising model with coupling strengths on vastly different scales, that is what you get. For instance, calculate the gap (the difference between the smallest and second smallest eigenvalue) of the Hamitonian $H_1=-1000\\sigma^Z_1\\sigma^Z_2-0.1\\sigma^Z_2\\sigma^Z_3-0.5\\sigma^Z_1$ acting on a three-qubit system (the last linear term is there to make the ground state unique).
