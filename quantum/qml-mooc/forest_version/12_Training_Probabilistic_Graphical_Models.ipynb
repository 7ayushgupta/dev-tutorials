    "The roots of probabilistic graphical models go back to the 1980s, with a strong connection to Bayesian statistics. The story resembles that of neural networks: they have been around for over three decades and they need massive computational power. However, unlike in the case of deep learning, the requirements for computational resources remain out of reach. These models require sampling a distribution, and very often it is the Boltzmann distribution. Since quantum computers can give samples from this distribution, we can hope that quantum hardware can enable these models the same way graphics processing units enabled deep learning.\n",

    "Probabilistic graphical models capture a compact representation of a joint probability distribution. For $\\{X_1,\\ldots,X_N\\}$ binary random variables, there are $2^N$ assignments. In a graphical model, complexity is dealt with through graph theory. We get both an efficient treatment of uncertainty (probabilities) and of logical structure (independence constraints). The factorization of the probabilities happens along conditional independences among random variables. The definition is that $X$ is conditionally independent of $Y$ given $Z$ $(X\\perp Y|Z)$, if $P(X=x, Y=y|Z=z) = P(X=x|Z=z)P(Y=y|Z=z)$ for all $x\\in X,y\\in Y,z\\in Z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph can be directed -- these are called Bayesian networks in general -- or undirected, in the case of Markov networks (also known as Markov random fields) [[1](#1)]. Graphical models are quintessentially generative: we explicitly model a probability distribution. Thus generating new samples is trivial and we can always introduce extra random variables to ensure certain properties. These models also take us a step closer to explainability, either by the use of the random variables directly for explanations (if your model is such) or by introducing explanatory random variables that correlate with the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Markov random field, we can allow cycles in the graph and switch from local normalization (conditional probability distribution at each node) to global normalization of probabilities (i.e. a partition function). Examples include countless applications in computer vision, pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, but also Ising models that we have seen before: the factors are defined as degree-1 and degree-2 monomials of the random variables connected in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The factorization is given as a sum $P(X_1, \\ldots, X_N) = \\frac{1}{Z}\\exp(-\\sum_k E[C_k])$, where $C_k$ are are cliques of the graph, and $E[.]$ is an energy defined over the cliques. If $P$ is a Boltzmann distribution over $G$, all local Markov properties will hold. The other way also holds if $P$ is a positive distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us define a Markov field of binary variables. This will be an Ising model over three nodes. This will contain three cliques of a single node (the on-site fields) and two cliques of two nodes: the edges that connect the nodes."
